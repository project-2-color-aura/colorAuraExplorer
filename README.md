## Color Aura Explorer

Javascript | HTML | CSS/Sass | RESTful API <br>

_A collaborative project between [Mel Peto](https://www.melpeto.com) and [Caroline Manalo](https://carolinemanalo.comdashin)_. <br>

How are you feeling today? Choose your emotion and get a reading from the Color Aura Explorer. This app uses fetch to pull a color scheme that matches your mood from a RESTful API, and provides some reflective advice and insight based on your mood today ;). Your aura is positively glowing! <br>

### Potential for Next Steps

- Changes to the overall layout of the app to make the color scheme/advice visible without scroll
- Randomize colours in each "mood". Right now, color schemes are limited to the same colours; this project originally used a different API (x-colors) which allowed for random colors matching the selected theme to be provided on each click, however reliability issues led to use of a more restrictive API.
- :rocket: Use AI to randomize the advice?!? Whoa :flying_saucer:
